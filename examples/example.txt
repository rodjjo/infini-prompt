{//: This is a comment!

Comments are ignored and not considered in the output it even can contain {}, however make sure to close the bracets in the coment if you put it there.
}

This is an example ! 

If you are not using a json file, you can use a text file with a json block.
The entrypoint is

```json
{
    "templates": {
        "data": {
            "fixed_value": "a fixed value",
            "colors": [
                "red", "green", "blue"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

test one: {fixed_value}

```template.a_long_text
I do not want to put this text inside a json file because it has many lines, and formating json it's not pleaseant.
By the way my favorite color is {colors}
```

test two:
{a_long_text}


You can access arguments passed to the generation like, meta_my_argument: {meta_my_argument}

You can take decision based on the pass number like {==:meta_pass_number|1|Let me put this text|Let me put another text!}

You passed a list for the template, each one receive one from that list, name of the list "my_counting" I reveived the text "{meta_current_my_counting}". Note Continuations received the same value :D

{==:meta_pass_number|0|Lets set a value to use in the next continuation: {set:value_of_prior_pass|Last value}}
{==:meta_pass_number|1|Lets check the a value from a previous pass: {opt:meta_last_value_of_prior_pass|I did not found the value set :()}}
